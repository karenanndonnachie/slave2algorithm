# MILESTONE (WEEK9)

This week we had a milestone short presentation of our projects. We got to see where everyone is up to and got a feedback where we need to go with our project.
I didn't get to say everything in the presentation but here I will write the details of how I'm going with my project, 'Remember U'.

## Project Continue

So After realising that I need to pixelate the image in order to get the right amount of pixel numbers for conversion. I utilised code from this website (https://byrodrigo.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/pixelate-with-processing/) to control the pixelation. Then I found out there are numbers in Console that represent each pixels in the donut picutre.

I copied all the necessary numbers into Notepad app and manually tidy them up so it looks like the numbers below with commas.
