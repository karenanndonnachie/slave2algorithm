## Quick presentations, Paper prototyping and Pseudo Code

## Paper Prototype 1

At first I was going to use the corona spreadingin Melbourne data to create but then I realised it's too negative and give an idea of 'death' to the audience. I liked this idea though because this is something continuous so the music will only end when the corona is completely gone in Melbourne.

So I decide to change to 'images covert into music box music' so it gives a hope instead. Personally I find a music box represent reminiscent of past memories. But people can think of a music box as whatever they like. My first paper prototype represents how I want to create a music box music from images before corona.
Fact that images are made up of numbers when they are transferred into digital form so I thought I could turn each pixels into numbers then using that data to create a music sheet for a music box.

## Paper Prototype 2

After making my first paper prototype 'Converting an image into music sheet for a music box' I thought I'm limiting myself to the frame called 'music sheet'. So I decide to just create
