## Quick presentations, Paper prototyping and Pseudo Code

My first paper prototype representing how I want to create a music box music from some kind of data.
At first I was going to use the corona spreadingin Melbourne data to create music out of that but then I realised it's too negative and might give an idea of 'death' to the audience.
So I decide to chang to 'images covert into music' so it gives hope instead. Personally I find a music box represents reminiscent of past memories. But people can think of a music box as whatever they like.
Fact that images are made up of numbers when they are transferred into data form so I thought I could turn each pixels into numbers then using that data to create a music sheet for a music box.
