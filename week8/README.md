# WEEK8

## Quick presentation 2/Individual Project Pseudocode/Paper Prototype 2/Project WIP

### Paper Prototype 2

My plan changed a little bit more from the last paper protype. I thought I was limting myself into a frame called 'a music box music sheet'. So, I changed my project direction to a website where users can upload their images then using algorithm to convert that images into a music box music only and ordering an actual physical music box as a side option.

### Starting project

Like any reality I faced the wall as soon as I started to research how to convert an image to numbers. When I searched 'How to convert an image to number' on Google only came up with things that I won't understand.

#### Test 1 (PHP)

It came up with numbers when I applied an image but it also had indications which array and which colours it was. Also another problem was I can only convert very small files.
