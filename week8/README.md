# WEEK8

## Quick presentation 2/Individual Project Pseudocode/Paper Prototype 2/Project WIP

### Paper Prototype 2

My plan changed a little bit more from the last paper protype. I thought I was limting myself into a frame called 'a music box music sheet'. So, I changed my porject direction to a website where users can upload their important images then using algorithm to convert that images into a music box music only and turning them into an actual physical music box as a side option.
