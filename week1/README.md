Week 1: We were divided into groups to experience and experiment how generative design works.
We utilised dice (in my case I used a virtual dice to roll) to determine what kind of possibilities we could come up with after setting up our own parameters.
My group came up with what, how and where method produce scribble outcomes. In the process we utilised our body to create them which was hard and tiring. From this activity we learnt that utilising computer system is so much easier to produce infinite outcomes than what humans can do.
